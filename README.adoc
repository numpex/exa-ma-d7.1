== Introduction

This repository contains a LaTeX style for deliverables in the context of the French initiative for Exascale computing NumPEx. 

This style is based on the deliverable template provided by the European project Hyperride.

== Basic usage:

Create a repository for your deliverable and use this repo as template.

The basic structure of a deliverable formatted according with these
styles should be (minimally):

    \documentclass[11pt]{report}
    \usepackage{numpex}  
    
    \begin{document}
    
    %% a Changelog. Each call to \istChange adds an entry to the
    %% changelog. After LaTeX is run, it will generate a table on page 2
    %% containing all changes. N.B.: I could not find a way to generate
    %% this table directly, so the whiledo{} loop in istprog.sty writes
    %% the changelog table to a temp file (more or less the way tables of
    %% content are generated), so you have to run LaTeX twice to update
    %% this table (as you would to update the TOC).
    \istChange{dd/mm/yyyy}{v1.o}{Name (Partner short name)}{Draft report template}
    \istChange{...}{}{...}{}
    \istChange{}{}{}{}

    %% Deliverable information
    \ProjectAcronym{numpex}
    \ProjectFullTitle{Hybrid Provision of Energy based on Reliability and Resiliency by Integration of Dc Equipment}
    \ProjectRefNo{957788}
    \delivNumber{Dx.y}
    \delivName{[Title as appears in the DoA]}
    \delivShortTile{Short Title}
    %% Lead partner
    \delivResponsible{[Responsible partner]} 
    \delivVersion{vn.n}
    \ActualDate{dd/mm/yyyy}
    \delivDissLevel{CO}
    \delivType{[Report, Prototype, Other]}
    \delivWP{WPx} % Workpackage x; not used at the moment
    \delivAuthor{Names of co-authors  (partners short names)}
    \delivFPAuthor{Names of co-authors  (partners short names)}
    \delivStatus{Draft}
    \delivKeywords{[List of free keywords relevant to the deliverable]}
    \delivTask{Tn.n}
    \delivStatus{[Draft, v1.0, v2.0, Final version]}
    \delivExecSummary{This is a summary of the deliverable; a paragraph or
    so to go on the cover page} 
    
    \makecover
    % page 3: table of contents
    \newpage
    \fancypagestyle{plain}{}
    
    \settableofcontents
    \tableofcontents
    
    \vfill
    \section*{List of abbreviations}
    
    \begin{tabular}[h]{ll}
     EC	        &	European Commission \\
     DoA	&	Description of Action\\
    \end{tabular}
    
    
    \newpage
    \section{Your first section}
    
    \subsection{A subsection of your first section}
    
    etc
    
    \bibliography{your-bib-file}
    \bibliographystyle{apacite} %% recommended 
    \{document}
