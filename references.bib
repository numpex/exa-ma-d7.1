            Reproducibility crisis urge scientists to promote transparency which allows peers to draw same conclusions after performing identical steps from hypothesis to results. Growing resources are developed to open the access to methods, data and source codes. Still, the computational environment, an interface between data and source code running analyses, is not addressed. Environments are usually described with software and library names associated with version labels or provided as an opaque container image. This is not enough to describe the complexity of the dependencies on which they rely to operate on. We describe this issue and illustrate how open tools like Guix can be used by any scientist to share their environment and allow peers to reproduce it. Some steps of research might not be fully reproducible, but at least, transparency for computation is technically addressable. These tools should be considered by scientists willing to promote transparency and open science.},

	abstract = {🎉 We're happy to share our developments as we approach the V111 release of Feel++. Following a refreshed naming strategy, we've moved to the -preview.x suffix from the conventional -alpha.x, -beta, or -rc labels. This change signifies our dedication to enhancing transparency and setting clear expectations for our pre-release versions.

Each pre-release version of Feel++ undergoes a rigorous process, encompassing detailed reviews, extensive tests across varied scenarios, and careful packaging. Our commitment to delivering a high-quality, reliable experience is reflected in our comprehensive platform support strategy. Alongside offering support for the latest two Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Ubuntu and the newest LTS version of Debian, we're excited to announce that Feel++ is now accessible to Windows users through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and to Mac users via MacPorts, Homebrew, Docker and now Apptainer. This expansion of platform support is a testament to our commitment to making Feel++ as accessible and versatile as possible for our diverse user base.

As we continue to refine and enhance Feel++, the V111 release promises to bring forward significant innovations and improvements. Stay tuned for further updates of Feel++.
