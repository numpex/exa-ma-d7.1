This can have different meanings, according to the requested goals (rank uncertainty sources, reduce them, estimate precisely a critical threshold or an optimal working point), and it could request mathematical methods with greater or lesser complexity. This paper introduces the Uranie platform, an open-source framework developed at the Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), in the nuclear energy division, in order to deal with uncertainty propagation, surrogate models, optimisation issues, code calibration, etc. This platform benefits from both its dependencies and from personal developments, to offer an efficient data handling model, a C++ and Python interface, advanced graphi graphical tools, several parallelisation solutions, etc. These methods can then be applied to many kinds of code (considered as black boxes by Uranie) so to many fields of physics as well. In this paper, the example of thermal exchange between a plate-sheet and a fluid is introduced to show how Uranie can be used to perform a large range of analysis.},

In this work, we propose a low-overhead high-frequency multi-level checkpoint technique in which we integrate a highly-reliable topology-aware Reed-Solomon encoding in a three-level checkpoint scheme. We efficiently hide the encoding time using one Fault-Tolerance dedicated thread per node. We implement our technique in the Fault Tolerance Interface FTI. We evaluate the correctness of our performance model and conduct a study of the reliability of our library. To demonstrate the performance of FTI, we present a case study of the Mw9.0 Tohoku Japan earthquake simulation with SPECFEM3D on TSUBAME2.0. We demonstrate a checkpoint overhead as low as 8\% on sustained 0.1 petaflops runs (1152 GPUs) while checkpointing at high frequency.},

	abstract = {In this work, we explore the numerical solution of geometric shape optimization problems using neural network-based approaches. This involves minimizing a numerical criterion that includes solving a partial differential equation with respect to a domain, often under geometric constraints like constant volume. Our goal is to develop a proof of concept using a flexible and parallelizable methodology to tackle these problems. We focus on a prototypal problem: minimizing the so-called Dirichlet energy with respect to the domain under a volume constraint, involving a Poisson equation in \${\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}2\$. We use physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to approximate the Poisson equation's solution on a given domain and represent the shape through a neural network that approximates a volume-preserving transformation from an initial shape to an optimal one. These processes are combined in a single optimization algorithm that minimizes the Dirichlet energy. One of the significant advantages of this approach is its parallelizable nature, which makes it easy to handle the addition of parameters. Additionally, it does not rely on shape derivative or adjoint calculations. Our approach is tested on Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions, parametric right-hand sides, and extended to Bernoulli-type free boundary problems. The source code for solving the shape optimization problem is open-source and freely available.},

            Reproducibility crisis urge scientists to promote transparency which allows peers to draw same conclusions after performing identical steps from hypothesis to results. Growing resources are developed to open the access to methods, data and source codes. Still, the computational environment, an interface between data and source code running analyses, is not addressed. Environments are usually described with software and library names associated with version labels or provided as an opaque container image. This is not enough to describe the complexity of the dependencies on which they rely to operate on. We describe this issue and illustrate how open tools like Guix can be used by any scientist to share their environment and allow peers to reproduce it. Some steps of research might not be fully reproducible, but at least, transparency for computation is technically addressable. These tools should be considered by scientists willing to promote transparency and open science.},
