	abstract = {🎉 We're happy to share our developments as we approach the V111 release of Feel++. Following a refreshed naming strategy, we've moved to the -preview.x suffix from the conventional -alpha.x, -beta, or -rc labels. This change signifies our dedication to enhancing transparency and setting clear expectations for our pre-release versions.

Each pre-release version of Feel++ undergoes a rigorous process, encompassing detailed reviews, extensive tests across varied scenarios, and careful packaging. Our commitment to delivering a high-quality, reliable experience is reflected in our comprehensive platform support strategy. Alongside offering support for the latest two Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Ubuntu and the newest LTS version of Debian, we're excited to announce that Feel++ is now accessible to Windows users through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and to Mac users via MacPorts, Homebrew, Docker and now Apptainer. This expansion of platform support is a testament to our commitment to making Feel++ as accessible and versatile as possible for our diverse user base.

As we continue to refine and enhance Feel++, the V111 release promises to bring forward significant innovations and improvements. Stay tuned for further updates of Feel++.

	abstract = {Given an input 3D geometry such as a triangle soup or a point set, we address the problem of generating a watertight and orientable surface triangle mesh that strictly encloses the input. The output mesh is obtained by greedily refining and carving a 3D Delaunay triangulation on an offset surface of the input, while carving with empty balls of radius alpha. The proposed algorithm is controlled via two user-defined parameters: alpha and offset. Alpha controls the size of cavities or holes that cannot be traversed during carving, while offset controls the distance between the vertices of the output mesh and the input. Our algorithm is guaranteed to terminate and to yield a valid and strictly enclosing mesh, even for defect-laden inputs. Genericity is achieved using an abstract interface probing the input, enabling any geometry to be used, provided a few basic geometric queries can be answered. We benchmark the algorithm on large public datasets such as Thingi10k, and compare it to state-of-the-art approaches in terms of robustness, approximation, output complexity, speed, and peak memory consumption. Our implementation is available through the CGAL library.},

	abstract = {CGALmesh is the mesh generation software package of the Computational Geometry Algorithm Library (CGAL). It generates isotropic simplicial meshes -- surface triangular meshes or volume tetrahedral meshes -- from input surfaces, 3D domains as well as 3D multi-domains, with or without sharp features. The underlying meshing algorithm relies on restricted Delaunay triangulations to approximate domains and surfaces, and on Delaunay refinement to ensure both approximation accuracy and mesh quality. CGALmesh provides guarantees on approximation quality as well as on the size and shape of the mesh elements. It provides four optional mesh optimization algorithms to further improve the mesh quality. A distinctive property of CGALmesh is its high flexibility with respect to the input domain representation. Such a flexibility is achieved through a careful software design, gathering into a single abstract concept, denoted by the oracle, all required interface features between the meshing engine and the input domain. We already provide oracles for domains defined by polyhedral and implicit surfaces.},

This can have different meanings, according to the requested goals (rank uncertainty sources, reduce them, estimate precisely a critical threshold or an optimal working point), and it could request mathematical methods with greater or lesser complexity. This paper introduces the Uranie platform, an open-source framework developed at the Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), in the nuclear energy division, in order to deal with uncertainty propagation, surrogate models, optimisation issues, code calibration, etc. This platform benefits from both its dependencies and from personal developments, to offer an efficient data handling model, a C++ and Python interface, advanced graphi graphical tools, several parallelisation solutions, etc. These methods can then be applied to many kinds of code (considered as black boxes by Uranie) so to many fields of physics as well. In this paper, the example of thermal exchange between a plate-sheet and a fluid is introduced to show how Uranie can be used to perform a large range of analysis.},

In this work, we propose a low-overhead high-frequency multi-level checkpoint technique in which we integrate a highly-reliable topology-aware Reed-Solomon encoding in a three-level checkpoint scheme. We efficiently hide the encoding time using one Fault-Tolerance dedicated thread per node. We implement our technique in the Fault Tolerance Interface FTI. We evaluate the correctness of our performance model and conduct a study of the reliability of our library. To demonstrate the performance of FTI, we present a case study of the Mw9.0 Tohoku Japan earthquake simulation with SPECFEM3D on TSUBAME2.0. We demonstrate a checkpoint overhead as low as 8\% on sustained 0.1 petaflops runs (1152 GPUs) while checkpointing at high frequency.},

	abstract = {In this work, we explore the numerical solution of geometric shape optimization problems using neural network-based approaches. This involves minimizing a numerical criterion that includes solving a partial differential equation with respect to a domain, often under geometric constraints like constant volume. Our goal is to develop a proof of concept using a flexible and parallelizable methodology to tackle these problems. We focus on a prototypal problem: minimizing the so-called Dirichlet energy with respect to the domain under a volume constraint, involving a Poisson equation in \${\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}2\$. We use physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to approximate the Poisson equation's solution on a given domain and represent the shape through a neural network that approximates a volume-preserving transformation from an initial shape to an optimal one. These processes are combined in a single optimization algorithm that minimizes the Dirichlet energy. One of the significant advantages of this approach is its parallelizable nature, which makes it easy to handle the addition of parameters. Additionally, it does not rely on shape derivative or adjoint calculations. Our approach is tested on Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions, parametric right-hand sides, and extended to Bernoulli-type free boundary problems. The source code for solving the shape optimization problem is open-source and freely available.},

            Reproducibility crisis urge scientists to promote transparency which allows peers to draw same conclusions after performing identical steps from hypothesis to results. Growing resources are developed to open the access to methods, data and source codes. Still, the computational environment, an interface between data and source code running analyses, is not addressed. Environments are usually described with software and library names associated with version labels or provided as an opaque container image. This is not enough to describe the complexity of the dependencies on which they rely to operate on. We describe this issue and illustrate how open tools like Guix can be used by any scientist to share their environment and allow peers to reproduce it. Some steps of research might not be fully reproducible, but at least, transparency for computation is technically addressable. These tools should be considered by scientists willing to promote transparency and open science.},

	abstract = {Deep learning hardware achieves high throughput and low power consumption by reducing computing precision and specializing in matrix multiplication. For machine learning inference, fixed-point value computation is commonplace, where the input and output values and the model parameters are quantized. Thus, many processors are now equipped with fast integer matrix multiplication units (IMMU). It is of significant interest to find a way to harness these IMMUs to improve the performance of HPC applications while maintaining accuracy. We focus on the Ozaki scheme, which computes a high-precision matrix multiplication by using lower-precision computing units, and show the advantages and disadvantages of using IMMU. The experiment using integer Tensor Cores shows that we can compute double-precision matrix multiplication faster than cuBLAS and an existing Ozaki scheme implementation on FP16 Tensor Cores on NVIDIA consumer GPUs. Furthermore, we demonstrate accelerating a quantum circuit simulation by up to 4.33 while maintaining the FP64 accuracy.},
