	abstract = {Deep learning hardware achieves high throughput and low power consumption by reducing computing precision and specializing in matrix multiplication. For machine learning inference, fixed-point value computation is commonplace, where the input and output values and the model parameters are quantized. Thus, many processors are now equipped with fast integer matrix multiplication units ({IMMU}). It is of significant interest to find a way to harness these {IMMUs} to improve the performance of {HPC} applications while maintaining accuracy. We focus on the Ozaki scheme, which computes a high-precision matrix multiplication by using lower-precision computing units, and show the advantages and disadvantages of using {IMMU}. The experiment using integer Tensor Cores shows that we can compute double-precision matrix multiplication faster than {cuBLAS} and an existing Ozaki scheme implementation on {FP}16 Tensor Cores on {NVIDIA} consumer {GPUs}. Furthermore, we demonstrate accelerating a quantum circuit simulation by up to 4.33 while maintaining the {FP}64 accuracy.},
