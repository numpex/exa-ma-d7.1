              With the recent arrival of the exascale era, modern supercomputers are increasingly big making their programming much more complex. In addition to performance, software productivity is a major concern to choose a programming language, such as Chapel, designed for exascale computing. In this paper, we investigate the design of a parallel distributed tree‐search algorithm, namely P3D‐DFS, and its implementation using Chapel. The design is based on the Chapel's
              DistBag
              data structure, revisited by: (1) redefining the data structure for Depth‐First tree‐Search (DFS), henceforth renamed
              DistBag‐DFS
              ; (2) redesigning the underlying load balancing mechanism. In addition, we propose two instantiations of P3D‐DFS considering the Branch‐and‐Bound (B\&B) and Unbalanced Tree Search (UTS) algorithms. In order to evaluate how much performance is traded for productivity, we compare the Chapel‐based implementations of B\&B and UTS to their best‐known counterparts based on traditional OpenMP (intra‐node) and MPI+X (inter‐node). For experimental validation using 4096 processing cores, we consider the permutation flow‐shop scheduling problem for B\&B and synthetic literature benchmarks for UTS. The reported results show that P3D‐DFS competes with its OpenMP baselines for coarser‐grained shared‐memory scenarios, and with its MPI+X counterparts for distributed‐memory settings, considering both performance and productivity‐awareness. In the context of this work, this makes Chapel an alternative to OpenMP/MPI+X for exascale programming.},

Taillard in 1993, 23 have remained unsolved for almost three decades. In this paper, we present our attempts to solve these instances to optimality using parallel Branch-and-Bound (BB) on the GPU-accelerated Jean Zay supercomputer. We report the exact solution of 11 previously unsolved problem instances and improved upper bounds for eight instances. The solution of these problems requires both algorithmic improvements and leveraging the computing power of peta-scale high-performance computing platforms. The challenge consists in efficiently performing parallel depth-first traversal of a highly irregular and fine-grained search tree on distributed systems composed of hundreds of massively parallel accelerator devices and multicore processors. We present and discuss the design and implementation of our permutation-based BB and experimentally evaluate its parallel performance on up to 384 V100 GPUs (2 million CUDA cores) and 3840 CPU cores. The optimality proof for the largest solved instance requires about 64 CPU-years of computation—using 256 GPUs and over 4 million parallel search agents, the traversal of the search tree is completed in 13 hours, exploring [Formula: see text] nodes.},

However, its applicability to high-resolution data, as produced by three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, is limited owing to its computational complexity. Here, we propose a wavelet-based adaptive version of the POD (the wPOD), in order to overcome this limitation. The amount of data to be analyzed is reduced by compressing them using biorthogonal wavelets, yielding a sparse representation while conveniently providing control of the compression error. Numerical analysis shows how the distinct error contributions of wavelet compression and POD truncation can be balanced under certain assumptions, allowing us to efficiently process high-resolution data from three-dimensional simulations of flow problems. Using a synthetic academic test case, we compare our algorithm with the randomized singular value decomposition. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our method analyzing data of a two-dimensional wake flow and a three-dimensional flow generated by a flapping insect computed with direct numerical simulation.},

	abstract = {Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) stand out for their simplicity and computational efficiency while offering the possibility of simulating complex phenomena. While they are optimal for Cartesian meshes, adapted meshes have traditionally been a stumbling block since it is difficult to predict the right physics through various levels of meshes. In this work, we design a class of fully adaptive LBM methods with dynamic mesh adaptation and error control relying on multiresolution analysis. This wavelet-based approach allows us to adapt the mesh based on the regularity of the solution and leads to a very efficient compression of the solution without loosing its quality and with the preservation of the properties of the original LBM method on the finest grid. This yields a general approach for a large spectrum of schemes and allows precise error bounds, without the need for deep modifications on the reference scheme. An error analysis is proposed. For the purpose of validating this error analysis, we conduct a series of test cases for various schemes and scalar and systems of conservation laws, where solutions with shocks are to be found and local mesh adaptation is especially relevant. Theoretical estimates are retrieved while a reduced memory footprint is observed. It paves the way to an implementation in a multidimensional framework and high computational efficiency of the method for both parabolic and hyperbolic equations, which is the subject of a companion paper.

	abstract = {Lattice-Boltzmann methods are known for their simplicity, efficiency and ease of parallelization, usually relying on uniform Cartesian meshes with a strong bond between spatial and temporal discretization. This fact complicates the crucial issue of reducing the computational cost and the memory impact by automatically coarsening the grid where a fine mesh is unnecessary, still ensuring the overall quality of the numerical solution through error control. This work provides a possible answer to this interesting question, by connecting, for the first time, the field of lattice-Boltzmann Methods (LBM) to the adaptive multiresolution (MR) approach based on wavelets. To this end, we employ a MR multi-scale transform to adapt the mesh as the solution evolves in time according to its local regularity. The collision phase is not affected due to its inherent local nature and because we do not modify the speed of the sound, contrarily to most of the LBM/Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategies proposed in the literature, thus preserving the original structure of any LBM scheme. Besides, an original use of the MR allows the scheme to resolve the proper physics by efficiently controlling the accuracy of the transport phase. We carefully test our method to conclude on its adaptability to a wide family of existing lattice Boltzmann schemes, treating both hyperbolic and parabolic systems of equations, thus being less problem-dependent than the AMR approaches, which have a hard time guaranteeing an effective control on the error. The ability of the method to yield a very efficient compression rate and thus a computational cost reduction for solutions involving localized structures with loss of regularity is also shown, while guaranteeing a precise control on the approximation error introduced by the spatial adaptation of the grid. The numerical strategy is implemented on a specific open-source platform called SAMURAI with a dedicated data-structure relying on set algebra.},

As a result, CUDA is increasingly important in scientific and technical computing across the whole STEM community, from medical physics and financial modelling to big data applications and beyond. This unique book on CUDA draws on the author's passion for and long experience of developing and using computers to acquire and analyse scientific data. The result is an innovative text featuring a much richer set of examples than found in any other comparable book on GPU computing. Much attention has been paid to the C++ coding style, which is compact, elegant and efficient. A code base of examples and supporting material is available online, which readers can build on for their own projects.},

This work focuses on modeling and simulating aqueous humor flow in the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye, coupled with overall heat transfer.
Aqueous humor dynamics regulates intraocular pressure, which is crucial for understanding conditions like glaucoma.
Convective effects from temperature disparities also influence this flow.

Moreover, it is often needed to solve these linear systems with different or multiple Right-Hand Sides (RHSs). In this paper, various strategies will be presented to extend the scalability of existing multigrid or domain decomposition linear solvers using appropriate recycling strategies or block methods---i.e., by treating multiple right-hand sides simultaneously.The scalability of this work is assessed by performing simulations on up to 8,192 cores for solving linear systems arising from various physical phenomena modeled by Poisson's equation, the system of linear elasticity, or Maxwell's equation.This work is shipped as part of on open-source software, readily available and usable in any C/C++, Python, or Fortran code. In particular, some simulations are performed on top of a well-established library, PETSc, and it is shown how our approaches can be used to decrease time to solution down by 30\%.},

	abstract = {Efficient frequency-domain full-waveform inversion (FWI) of long-offset node data can be designed with a few discrete frequencies, which lead to modest data volumes to be managed during the inversion process. Moreover, attenuation effects can be straightforwardly implemented in the forward problem without the computational overhead. However, 3D frequency-domain seismic modeling is challenging because it requires solving a large and sparse linear indefinite system for each frequency with multiple right-hand sides (RHSs). This linear system can be solved by direct or iterative methods. The former allows efficient processing of multiple RHSs but may suffer from limited scalability for very large problems. Iterative methods equipped with a domain-decomposition preconditioner provide a suitable alternative to process large computational domains for sparse-node acquisition. We have investigated the domain-decomposition preconditioner based on the optimized restricted additive Schwarz (ORAS) method, in which a Robin or perfectly matched layer condition is implemented at the boundaries between the subdomains. The preconditioned system is solved by a Krylov subspace method, whereas a block low-rank lower-upper decomposition of the local matrices is performed at a preprocessing stage. Multiple sources are processed in groups with a pseudoblock method. The accuracy, the computational cost, and the scalability of the ORAS solver are assessed against several realistic benchmarks. In terms of discretization, we compare a compact wavelength-adaptive 27-point finite-difference stencil on a regular Cartesian grid with a P 
              3 
              finite-element method on h-adaptive tetrahedral mesh. Although both schemes have comparable accuracy, the former is more computationally efficient, the latter being beneficial to comply with known boundaries such as bathymetry. The scalability of the method, the block processing of multiple RHSs, and the straightforward implementation of attenuation, which further improves the convergence of the iterative solver, make the method a versatile forward engine for large-scale 3D FWI applications from sparse node data sets.},

	abstract = {This work is based on the seminar titled ‘Resiliency in Numerical Algorithm Design for Extreme Scale Simulations’ held March 1–6, 2020, at Schloss Dagstuhl, that was attended by all the authors. Advanced supercomputing is characterized by very high computation speeds at the cost of involving an enormous amount of resources and costs. A typical large-scale computation running for 48 h on a system consuming 20 MW, as predicted for exascale systems, would consume a million kWh, corresponding to about 100k Euro in energy cost for executing 10 
              23 
              floating-point operations. It is clearly unacceptable to lose the whole computation if any of the several million parallel processes fails during the execution. Moreover, if a single operation suffers from a bit-flip error, should the whole computation be declared invalid? What about the notion of reproducibility itself: should this core paradigm of science be revised and refined for results that are obtained by large-scale simulation? Naive versions of conventional resilience techniques will not scale to the exascale regime: with a main memory footprint of tens of Petabytes, synchronously writing checkpoint data all the way to background storage at frequent intervals will create intolerable overheads in runtime and energy consumption. Forecasts show that the mean time between failures could be lower than the time to recover from such a checkpoint, so that large calculations at scale might not make any progress if robust alternatives are not investigated. More advanced resilience techniques must be devised. The key may lie in exploiting both advanced system features as well as specific application knowledge. Research will face two essential questions: (1) what are the reliability requirements for a particular computation and (2) how do we best design the algorithms and software to meet these requirements? While the analysis of use cases can help understand the particular reliability requirements, the construction of remedies is currently wide open. One avenue would be to refine and improve on system- or application-level checkpointing and rollback strategies in the case an error is detected. Developers might use fault notification interfaces and flexible runtime systems to respond to node failures in an application-dependent fashion. Novel numerical algorithms or more stochastic computational approaches may be required to meet accuracy requirements in the face of undetectable soft errors. These ideas constituted an essential topic of the seminar. The goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together a diverse group of scientists with expertise in exascale computing to discuss novel ways to make applications resilient against detected and undetected faults. In particular, participants explored the role that algorithms and applications play in the holistic approach needed to tackle this challenge. This article gathers a broad range of perspectives on the role of algorithms, applications and systems in achieving resilience for extreme scale simulations. The ultimate goal is to spark novel ideas and encourage the development of concrete solutions for achieving such resilience holistically.},

	abstract = {Solar oscillations can be modeled by Galbrun's equation which describes Lagrangian wave displacement in a self-gravitating stratified medium. For spherically symmetric backgrounds, we construct an algorithm to compute efficiently and accurately the coefficients of the Green's tensor of the time-harmonic equation in vector spherical harmonic basis. With only two resolutions, our algorithm provides values of the kernels for all heights of source and receiver, and prescribes analytically the singularities of the kernels. We also derive absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) to model wave propagation in the atmosphere above the cut-off frequency. The construction of ABC, which contains varying gravity terms, is rendered difficult by the complex behavior of the solar potential in low atmosphere and for frequencies below the Lamb frequency. We carry out extensive numerical investigations to compare and evaluate the efficiency of the ABCs in capturing outgoing solutions. Finally, as an application towards helioseismology, we compute synthetic solar power spectra that contain pressure modes as well as internal-gravity (g-) and surface-gravity (f-) ridges which are missing in simpler approximations of the wave equation. For purpose of validation, the locations of the ridges in the synthetic power spectra are compared with observed solar modes.},

	abstract = {We present a technique for the rapid and reliable prediction of linear-functional outputs of elliptic (and parabolic) partial differential equations with affine parameter dependence. The essential components are (i) (provably) rapidly convergent global reduced-basis approximations—Galerkin projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter space; (ii) a posteriori error estimation—relaxations of the error-residual equation that provide inexpensive yet sharp and rigorous bounds for the error in the outputs of interest; and (iii) off-line/on-line computational procedures methods which decouple the generation and projection stages of the approximation process. The operation count for the on-line stage in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound, depends only on N (typically very small) and the parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for the repeated and rapid evaluations required in the context of parameter estimation, design, optimization, and real-time control.},

	abstract = {🎉 We're happy to share our developments as we approach the V111 release of Feel++. Following a refreshed naming strategy, we've moved to the -preview.x suffix from the conventional -alpha.x, -beta, or -rc labels. This change signifies our dedication to enhancing transparency and setting clear expectations for our pre-release versions.

Each pre-release version of Feel++ undergoes a rigorous process, encompassing detailed reviews, extensive tests across varied scenarios, and careful packaging. Our commitment to delivering a high-quality, reliable experience is reflected in our comprehensive platform support strategy. Alongside offering support for the latest two Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Ubuntu and the newest LTS version of Debian, we're excited to announce that Feel++ is now accessible to Windows users through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and to Mac users via MacPorts, Homebrew, Docker and now Apptainer. This expansion of platform support is a testament to our commitment to making Feel++ as accessible and versatile as possible for our diverse user base.

As we continue to refine and enhance Feel++, the V111 release promises to bring forward significant innovations and improvements. Stay tuned for further updates of Feel++.

	abstract = {Given an input 3D geometry such as a triangle soup or a point set, we address the problem of generating a watertight and orientable surface triangle mesh that strictly encloses the input. The output mesh is obtained by greedily refining and carving a 3D Delaunay triangulation on an offset surface of the input, while carving with empty balls of radius alpha. The proposed algorithm is controlled via two user-defined parameters: alpha and offset. Alpha controls the size of cavities or holes that cannot be traversed during carving, while offset controls the distance between the vertices of the output mesh and the input. Our algorithm is guaranteed to terminate and to yield a valid and strictly enclosing mesh, even for defect-laden inputs. Genericity is achieved using an abstract interface probing the input, enabling any geometry to be used, provided a few basic geometric queries can be answered. We benchmark the algorithm on large public datasets such as Thingi10k, and compare it to state-of-the-art approaches in terms of robustness, approximation, output complexity, speed, and peak memory consumption. Our implementation is available through the CGAL library.},

	abstract = {CGALmesh is the mesh generation software package of the Computational Geometry Algorithm Library (CGAL). It generates isotropic simplicial meshes -- surface triangular meshes or volume tetrahedral meshes -- from input surfaces, 3D domains as well as 3D multi-domains, with or without sharp features. The underlying meshing algorithm relies on restricted Delaunay triangulations to approximate domains and surfaces, and on Delaunay refinement to ensure both approximation accuracy and mesh quality. CGALmesh provides guarantees on approximation quality as well as on the size and shape of the mesh elements. It provides four optional mesh optimization algorithms to further improve the mesh quality. A distinctive property of CGALmesh is its high flexibility with respect to the input domain representation. Such a flexibility is achieved through a careful software design, gathering into a single abstract concept, denoted by the oracle, all required interface features between the meshing engine and the input domain. We already provide oracles for domains defined by polyhedral and implicit surfaces.},

This can have different meanings, according to the requested goals (rank uncertainty sources, reduce them, estimate precisely a critical threshold or an optimal working point), and it could request mathematical methods with greater or lesser complexity. This paper introduces the Uranie platform, an open-source framework developed at the Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), in the nuclear energy division, in order to deal with uncertainty propagation, surrogate models, optimisation issues, code calibration, etc. This platform benefits from both its dependencies and from personal developments, to offer an efficient data handling model, a C++ and Python interface, advanced graphi graphical tools, several parallelisation solutions, etc. These methods can then be applied to many kinds of code (considered as black boxes by Uranie) so to many fields of physics as well. In this paper, the example of thermal exchange between a plate-sheet and a fluid is introduced to show how Uranie can be used to perform a large range of analysis.},

New fault tolerant techniques will be critical to efficiently exploit post-petascale systems. In this work, we propose a low-overhead high-frequency multi-level checkpoint technique in which we integrate a highly-reliable topology-aware Reed-Solomon encoding in a three-level checkpoint scheme. We efficiently hide the encoding time using one Fault-Tolerance dedicated thread per node. We implement our technique in the Fault Tolerance Interface FTI. We evaluate the correctness of our performance model and conduct a study of the reliability of our library. To demonstrate the performance of FTI, we present a case study of the Mw9.0 Tohoku Japan earthquake simulation with SPECFEM3D on TSUBAME2.0. We demonstrate a checkpoint overhead as low as 8\% on sustained 0.1 petaflops runs (1152 GPUs) while checkpointing at high frequency.},

	abstract = {In this work, we explore the numerical solution of geometric shape optimization problems using neural network-based approaches. This involves minimizing a numerical criterion that includes solving a partial differential equation with respect to a domain, often under geometric constraints like constant volume. Our goal is to develop a proof of concept using a flexible and parallelizable methodology to tackle these problems. We focus on a prototypal problem: minimizing the so-called Dirichlet energy with respect to the domain under a volume constraint, involving a Poisson equation in \${\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}2\$. We use physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to approximate the Poisson equation's solution on a given domain and represent the shape through a neural network that approximates a volume-preserving transformation from an initial shape to an optimal one. These processes are combined in a single optimization algorithm that minimizes the Dirichlet energy. One of the significant advantages of this approach is its parallelizable nature, which makes it easy to handle the addition of parameters. Additionally, it does not rely on shape derivative or adjoint calculations. Our approach is tested on Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions, parametric right-hand sides, and extended to Bernoulli-type free boundary problems. The source code for solving the shape optimization problem is open-source and freely available.},

            Reproducibility crisis urge scientists to promote transparency which allows peers to draw same conclusions after performing identical steps from hypothesis to results. Growing resources are developed to open the access to methods, data and source codes. Still, the computational environment, an interface between data and source code running analyses, is not addressed. Environments are usually described with software and library names associated with version labels or provided as an opaque container image. This is not enough to describe the complexity of the dependencies on which they rely to operate on. We describe this issue and illustrate how open tools like Guix can be used by any scientist to share their environment and allow peers to reproduce it. Some steps of research might not be fully reproducible, but at least, transparency for computation is technically addressable. These tools should be considered by scientists willing to promote transparency and open science.},

	abstract = {Deep learning hardware achieves high throughput and low power consumption by reducing computing precision and specializing in matrix multiplication. For machine learning inference, fixed-point value computation is commonplace, where the input and output values and the model parameters are quantized. Thus, many processors are now equipped with fast integer matrix multiplication units (IMMU). It is of significant interest to find a way to harness these IMMUs to improve the performance of HPC applications while maintaining accuracy. We focus on the Ozaki scheme, which computes a high-precision matrix multiplication by using lower-precision computing units, and show the advantages and disadvantages of using IMMU. The experiment using integer Tensor Cores shows that we can compute double-precision matrix multiplication faster than cuBLAS and an existing Ozaki scheme implementation on FP16 Tensor Cores on NVIDIA consumer GPUs. Furthermore, we demonstrate accelerating a quantum circuit simulation by up to 4.33 while maintaining the FP64 accuracy.},
