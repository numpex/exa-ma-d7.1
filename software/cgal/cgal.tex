\subsection{Software summary}
\label{sec:CGAL:summary}
%Detailed overview not available.

CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) is an open-source software project designed to provide 
numerically reliable software components (algorithms and geometric data structures) for use in 2D, 3D, or arbitrary dimensions.
These components include convex hulls, triangulations, Boolean operations, intersection calculations, mesh generation, 
3D point cloud processing, and more. CGALâ€™s main design features, along with various components, are utilized in industrial 
robotics and digital engineering simulations. For industrial applications, CGAL offers reliable, interoperable components 
that save development time by eliminating the need to reinvent the wheel, allowing users to focus on the business specializations 
that deliver the most value.




\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sec:CGAL:purpose}
%Purpose not available.

The purpose of CGAL is to offer developers tools for solving complex geometric problems in the form of a C++ templated library. 
CGAL is used in fields like CAD, robotics, and scientific computing, offering components for tasks like mesh generation, 
spatial searching, and geometry processing. CGAL is available under a dual licensing scheme: for integration into other open-source software, 
it is provided under LGPL or GPL licenses, depending on the component. For proprietary or commercial projects, 
licenses can be purchased, with options tailored for academic, research, or industrial customers.

%In this section, provide a summary the mathematics used in the software.


Numerical robustness is a fundamental concern in geometric computing, even more so than in other types of numerical methods. 
In geometric algorithms, slight inaccuracies in numerical computations can lead to significant errors, such as incorrect topological 
configurations or degeneracies that disrupt the algorithm's logic. 
The CGAL offers a flexible and powerful solution to this problem by following the exact computation paradigm (\url{https://www.cgal.org/exact.html}),
enabling users to avoid rounding errors and ensure robust algorithms.

CGAL leverages generic programming, enabling the use of different components through a C++ templated environment. 
This approach allows algorithms and data structures to be flexible and reusable across various geometric scenarios. 
For instance, a 2D convex hull algorithm in CGAL can be applied to an arbitrary 3D plane by utilizing appropriate templated parameters. 
This templated design ensures that developers can extend or customize components easily to 
meet specific requirements.
