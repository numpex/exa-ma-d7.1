\subsection{Software summary}
\label{sec:Feelpp:summary}
\Feelpp is a C++ framework for multiphysics simulations based on the finite element method. 
It is designed to handle complex simulations in a wide variety of fields, including fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and solid mechanics. 
It focuses on high-performance computing and reproducibility in scientific computation.

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sec:Feelpp:purpose}
\Feelpp aims to provide a flexible and efficient environment for conducting finite element analysis in multiple scientific domains. 
It allows for the rapid prototyping of numerical models and is built with parallel computing in mind to scale on modern HPC architectures.

\subsection{Programming and Computational Environment}
\label{sec::Feelpp:environment_capabilities}

The following table summarizes these aspects for \Feelpp, providing a view of its programming and computational capabilities.

        \rowcolor{white}Languages  & \begin{tabular}{l}
C++\\
C++17\\
C++20\\
Python\\
\end{tabular} & Feel++ is primarily developed in C++ and supports modern C++ standards, including C++17 and C++20, which provide enhanced performance, safety features, and modern programming paradigms for high-performance computing applications. This allows Feel++ to leverage advanced language features such as constexpr, parallel algorithms, and enhanced lambda expressions, improving both code maintainability and computational efficiency. Additionally, Feel++ integrates with Python, enabling scripting capabilities and facilitating ease of use for rapid prototyping, automation, and integration with scientific workflows. This dual-language support provides flexibility for both performance-critical tasks and user-friendly interfaces. \\
        \rowcolor{numpexlightergray}Parallelism  & \begin{tabular}{l}
MPI\\
Parallelism - C++\\
Task based\\
\end{tabular} & Feel++ offers robust support for parallel computing, making it suitable for high-performance simulations. It utilizes MPI (Message Passing Interface) for distributed memory parallelism, enabling efficient communication between processes across different nodes in HPC environments. Additionally, Feel++ implements parallelism directly in C++, allowing fine-grained control over threading and parallel execution within shared memory systems. The framework also supports task-based parallelism thanks to specx, enabling the efficient execution of independent computational tasks, improving load balancing, and optimizing resource usage across heterogeneous computing architectures. This parallelism support ensures scalability and high performance in complex multiphysics simulations.\\
        \rowcolor{white}Data Formats  & \begin{tabular}{l}
Data-management system\\
Ensight\\
Gmsh and associated formats\\

\end{tabular} & Feel++ supports data management, including remote data management systems such as Girder and GitHub. It handles a variety of input and output formats, including Ensight, Gmsh, HDF5, JSON, VTK, YAML, and an in-house format. This flexibility enables Feel++ to align with the \textbf{FAIR} principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), ensuring efficient data sharing and reuse across different platforms and tools.\\
        \rowcolor{numpexlightergray}Resilience  & \begin{tabular}{l}
Checkpoint restart\\
\end{tabular} & Feel++ provides resilience support through checkpoint restart functionality. This allows simulations to save their state at specific points, enabling recovery from failures without restarting from the beginning. Binary in-house formats are used for fast restarts, ensuring minimal downtime and efficient continuation of long-running computations, especially on large-scale HPC systems.\\
