\subsection{Software Overview}
\label{sec:WP3:TRUST Platform:summary}

In~\cref{tab:WP3:TRUST Platform:features} we provide a summary of the software features relevant to the work package which are briefly discussed.

\subsection{Parallel Capabilities}
\label{sec:WP3:TRUST Platform:performances}


\begin{itemize}
    \item The parallel programming model is MPI and a mix of Kokkos and OpenMP-target directives for GPU computing  
    \item The parallel computation environment are personal computers, clusters, and super computers: e.g. Adastra (CINES), Jean-Zay (IDRIS), Topaze (CCRT)
    \item The code can run on several cores of one or several CPU nodes. A GPU version (limited to some physical modules) of the code may run on one or several GPU, on one or several nodes.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The parallel efficacity on CPU nodes (128 AMD Rome cores/node) declines from ~90% on 4 nodes, ~80% on 32 nodes, to ~60% on 256 nodes during a weak scaling test. The parallel efficacity on GPU nodes (4 GPU Nvidia V100/node) declines quicker from ~60% on 4 nodes, ~35% on 32 nodes, to 20% on 256 nodes during the same weak scaling test.
    \item \textbf{Integration with Other Systems:} TRUST integrates with the linear algebra libraries developed and improved in the Exa-Ma framework and especially those interfaced through PETSc. It thus serves for the practical evaluation of the integral performance gain provided by the project in representative physical cases of interest.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Initial Performance Metrics}
\label{sec:WP3:TRUST Platform:metrics}

Establishing reference metrics for TRUST to serve as basic data for the methodology proposed in chapter \ref{chap:methodology} is an ongoing process that will continue during the upcoming year. However, some solid elements are available concerning the relevant tests to be implemented, emphasizing on the relation between TRUST and linear algebra libraries supported in WP3, and with PETSc in particuler:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Weak scaling test for GPU: } using Krylov solver with algebraic multigrid preconditioner (e.g Hypre or AmgX) through PETSc on 2 to 1024 GPUs
    \item\textbf{Weak scaling test for CPU: } using Krylov solver with algebraic multigrid preconditioner (e.g. Hypre) through PETSc on 8 to 32768 CPUs
    \item \textbf{Strong scaling for CPU: } using MUMPS direct solver through PETSc on 1 to 128 cores
\end{itemize}

Current observations state that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Weak scaling test for GPU: } the scalability can be improved, in particular with :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the fine tuning of the already tested libraries or the choice and integration of new libraries, with a particular focus on the converence rate,
        \item the improvement of the robustness of the MPI communications between GPUs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item\textbf{Weak scaling test for CPU: } the scalability already reaches satisfactory levels, but some improvement can yet be expected from the advanced management of MPI communications with a focus on collective communications.
    \item \textbf{Strong scaling for CPU: } these tests are great interest for component applications (i.e. complex physics, smaller models) that can be involved in multiphysics and partitioned coupling.
\end{itemize}

Tests for performance evaluation of the hybrid CPU-GPU run modes will be considered in a second step.

\subsection{12-Month Roadmap}
\label{sec:WP3:TRUST Platform:roadmap}

The 12-Month Roadmap for TRUST platform is mainly dedicated to the implementation of tests identified in the previous section in the methodology proposed in section \ref{sec:methodology-types}, in terms of scalability analysis for CPU or GPU in a first step, and of hybrid benchmarking for CPU-GPU in a second step (post-12 month perspective).\\
\\
Practically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data availability:} Data for the selected benchmarks will be made available in a format readable with open-source only software, namely from the Salome environment (\href{https://www.salome-platform.org/}{https://www.salome-platform.org/}).
    \item \textbf{Methodology Application:} Implementation of the benchmarking methodology in terms of scalability measurements, with a particular focus on the selection of the relevant output data and associated tolerance for the reproducibility guarantee.
    \item \textbf{Results Retention:} Benchmark results will be stored and made available with the suitable level of metadata and documentation through a dedicated repository proposed by the Exa-MA project.
\end{itemize}

In~\cref{tab:WP3:TRUST Platform:bottlenecks}, we briefly discuss the bottleneck roadmap associated to the software and relevant to the work package.
