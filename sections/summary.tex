From Wikipedia:\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_summary}}

An executive summary, or management summary, is a short document or section of a document, produced for business purposes, that summarises a longer report or proposal or a group of related reports in such a way that readers can rapidly become acquainted with a large body of material without having to read it all. It usually contains a brief statement of the problem or proposal covered in the major document(s), background information, concise analysis and main conclusions. 
It is intended as an aid to decision-making by managers and has been described as the most important part of a business plan.

An executive summary differs from an abstract in that an abstract will usually be shorter and is intended to provide a neutral overview or orientation rather than being a condensed version of the full document. Abstracts are extensively used in academic research where the concept of the executive summary would be meaningless. ``An abstract is a brief summarising statement~\dots read by parties who are trying to decide whether or not to read the main document'', while ``an executive summary, unlike an abstract, is a document in miniature that may be read in place of the longer document''.

Structure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Be approximately 1-2 pages long
	\item Be written in language appropriate for the target audience
	\item Consist of short, concise paragraphs
	\item Begin with a summary
	\item Be written in the same order as the main report
	\item Only include material present in the main report
	\item Make recommendations
	\item Provide a justification
	\item Have a conclusion
	\item Be readable separately from the main report
	\item Sometimes summarise more than one document
\end{itemize}
