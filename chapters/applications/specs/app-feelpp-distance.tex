\subsection{Benchmarking tools used}

Description of the benchmarking tools used, as well as the metrics that are used.

\subsection{Input/Output Dataset Description}


\subsubsection{Input Data:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Meshes: ...
  \item Setup: ...
  \item Sif image: ...
  \item ...
  \end{itemize}

Include table of figure that are relevant (size of the meshes, etc...)

\subsubsection{Output Data:}

The output includes the computed values of validation measure in CSV files format, export visualization files (mesh, partitioning, temperature), and the time taken to perform each simulation step.
Metric:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{benchmark-verification},
    \item \texttt{strong-scalability},
    \item \texttt{weak-scalability},
    \item \texttt{io-scaling}: time taken by the application to read meshes, and to write the solution on disk (especially reading).
\end{itemize}
